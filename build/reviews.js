It was cumbersome, and took a ridiculous amount of time and effort to set up and GIVE them Money. Transferring money which you must first deposit with Sterling to invest with their partner, TDA, takes a ridiculous amount of time. Their website is very poorly designed.... your account links are on the left margin, blank space to the right....click a link, and you don\'t see that your info has loaded far down on the page. EVERY year-end (December), there is an issue with incorrect information on the site about next year\'s contribution limits and the application appears to allow scheduling a contribution in December for a January contribution, but in fact fails. Every year I ask to have this escalated to the Tech Dept, and every year the problem persists. After yet another change to terms (they now require I keep an extra $500 idle in the base account and cannot transfer / invest it at TDA, so they earn money on my money, while I lose out), I am trying to transfer to a new HSA administrator and shut this mess down. NO progress in over two weeks and multiple calls, letters, emails from me, TDA,or Fidelity (new HSA administrator); I now discovered multiple Service reps gave me explicitly wrong info. Promises for a call back result in no call. They don\'t tell you upfront, but they have no process or will not do an institution-to-institution transfer if you want to move your HSA to another administrator. Apparently, they\'ll take your money but make it very difficult to get it back.
